        <h1>Aces High Football Captain Headed to Oregon State University</h1>
      <p>Chris Porowski, 17, is Aces' next rising star. Even though the school year just started he's already committed to Oregon State University on a football scholarship after being picked up by their talent scout at the final game of last year's varsity season. In addition to being captain of the football team, Porowski is also the head of the student body and a straight A student.</p>
