        <h1>Shipwrecks Around Aces Oregon</h1>
        <p>Aces, Oregon, as a town on the coast, of course has a long history with the sea. However, the rocky cliffs have often posed a threat to the ships that sailed there. When it was founded in the 1800s, Aces was a community of craftsmen who often got shipments of materials by ship. However, ships would often not be able to see the port at nighttime, and instead crashed into the treacherous rocks that surround Joker's Bluff. Perhaps the most famous of these shipwrecks was that of Captain Alexander Wharton's ship "The Intrepid" which crashed in 1823, killing all 140 crewmates and sinking their cargo of rare sandstone imported from Egypt. Some even say that they kept in the hold a sarcophagus stolen from a tomb, which unleashed a curse that caused the ship to sink. Regardless of if the curse was real, this incident led to the opening of the lighthouse the following year.</p>
