        <h1>Local Breakfast Challenge Beat</h1>
        <p>If breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and no town takes that more seriously that Aces, Oregon. Moe's Diner, a local staple, has been running a challenge of massive proportions for the past 5 years, a challenge that remained undefeated for 5 whole years. That is, until local man Roger Norville had something to say about it. This colossal challenge asked challengers to eat 12 pancakes, a dozen eggs, 6 strips of bacon, 6 sausage links, and a Diet Coke in under half an hour. Not only was Norville the first to ever complete it, he did it with 15 minutes to spare. When we asked him about it, he said, "Like, I didn't even know it was a challenge, man. I woke up and really wanted a Diet Coke, so I scootered over to Moe's Diner and I saw a big sign advertising all this stuff with a Diet Coke. I didn't even know it was a challenge, I just shotgunned my Diet Coke then ate everything else they gave me. I was halfway out the door when they told me I just beat a challenge. They even took my picture and put it on the wall, which I thought was pretty cool. I've had my picture in the post office, but never in a restaurant. Man, I really gotta tell my boss Mr. Peters at the grocery store about this. He's nuts about this kinda stuff. Way better than Old Mr. Dawn at the Steel Mill. I'm so glad I left that place." Roger then scootered off in a hurry, and we were unable to get any further comment from him.</p>
